    "### Moneyball\n",
    "\n",
    "Moneyball is a tactic of Billy Beane, who was the general manager of the Oakland Athletics baseball team in the early 2000s. The Moneyball story revolves around Beane's innovative approach to assembling a competitive team on a limited budget, using statistical analysis to identify undervalued players and build a winning team. You'll be doing the same thing in this project!\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time, baseball teams often relied on traditional scouting methods to evaluate players, such as watching them play in person and relying on opinions. Beane believed that statistical analysis could be used to identify players who were undervalued by other teams, and therefore could be acquired at a lower cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite skepticism from many in the baseball community, Beane's approach proved successful, as the Athletics went on to make the playoffs in several consecutive years despite having one of the lowest payrolls in the league. The Moneyball story has since become a popular example of how data-driven decision making can lead to success in sports and other fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have some overall context for the project, we can start learning about the basics of baseball! Take some time to watch the following video, and make sure you understand how the game works overall!\n",
